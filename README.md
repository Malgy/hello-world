# hello-world

This is my first repository!
This is my short bio for GitHub.

My name is Anthony.
  I am a programmer based in the tri-state area, primarily New Jersey.
  I graduated high school in 2011 at Voorhees in Glen Gardner, NJ and found an affinity for filmography
    which turned into a hobby of automotive photography.
  I go to Kean University and expect to graduate in the Spring of 2017 with my Bachelors degree in
    Computer Science Information Systems.
